# FASERIP Python Conversion Project
[FASERIP](https://www.faserip.com/downloads.html) is Jonathan Nolan's non-infringing fan-project adaption of the 1980s Marvel TTRPG. JMCC is/was a Java-based character generator for the system which inspired that adaption.

## Intent
This (casual) project intends to convert or adapt existing functionality, with sufficient adaptions to be a FASERIP
